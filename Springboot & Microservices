1.) Why nomonolith?
    Very complex
    Difficult to maintain
    Slow development
    Entire app redeployement for small changes
    Resource required to run services will be more
    Limited scaling
    Unreliable
    Inflexible to upgrade to new frameworks
2.) Multiple small set of services interacting with each other to solve a single problem.
    Eg: e-commerce sites can have payment, cart, checkout services etc.

                                                                          |
                                                                          |

3.) Features:
    Language independent
    Small
    Easy to manage and maintain
    Loosely coupled
4.) Advantages:
    Independent developement
    Independent deployement
    Manageable
    Fault isolation (one failure not makes entire app down)
    Granular scaling (each service can be scaled)
